The goal in creating Cogent Roleplay, has been to create a role-playing system as simple and diverse as possible. In doing so, we understand that, though applications of such a system may be endless, many players enjoy using classic role-play settings like Medieval Fantasy.

We have created some examples of supplementary rules that can be used for some of the more oft-used settings while providing them to you as an example of how you can supplement the Cogent system with your own ideas!

We donâ€™t claim that these supplementary rules are perfectly balanced to be universally applicable, but we do hope that they provide a solid example to you of how to apply the system in ways most suited to your own needs.
