# Running the Game

This chapter is less of rules that Narrators must follow, and more of a toolbox of methods recommended to manager your Stories.  Narrators are encouraged to use the method that best fits the situation in the Story.

## Story Structure

**Cogent Roleplay** attempts to follow the structure and flow you will find in book series, TV shows, or plays.  Most *Campaigns* (a collection of *Stories*) will follow (loosely) the following structure:
* **Campaign:** This is the the whole collective story the Players and their Characters engage in.  It is similar to the entire book series, then entire TV show (all seasons), or the full collection of related plays.  *Campaigns* typically take years to complete.
* **Story Arcs:** *Campaigns* are broken into *Story Arcs*.  Each *Story Arc* could act as an independent *Campaign*, or build on other *Story Arcs* to tell a grand overarching narrative.  It is similar to a single book in the series, a single season of a TV show, or a single play.  *Story Arcs* will take anywhere between 1 month, to 1 year to complete.
* **Chapter:** *Story Arcs* are broken into *Chapters*.  *Chapters* typically have a single narrative arc (a problem for the Characters to overcome), and *Chapters* follow the standard Story build-up, climax, and resolution arc typical to most stories.  It is similar to a chapter in a book, a show in a TV series, or an act in a play.  You can expect a *Chapter* to take between 1-3 gaming sessions to complete.
* **Scene:** *Chapters* are broken into *Scenes*.  A *Scene* builds up to a single challenge or opportunity for the Characters involved.  Typically you will have one major Dice Roll per *Scene*.  It is similar to a page in a book, a scene in a TV show, or play.

## Narration

The role of the Narrator is to facilitate the flow of the Story.  You are there to ensure the Characters have the opportunity to play their part in the grand narrative, and that everyone collaborates in the creation of the Story.  

* Combat Encounters
* Investigations
* Etiquette
* Barter
