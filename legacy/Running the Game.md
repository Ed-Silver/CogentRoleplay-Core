# Running the Game

This chapter is less of rules that Narrators must follow, and more of a toolbox of methods recommended to manager your Stories.  Narrators are encouraged to use the method that best fits the situation in the Story.

## Story Structure

**Cogent Roleplay** attempts to follow the structure and flow you will find in book series, TV shows, or plays.  Most *Campaigns* (a collection of *Stories*) will follow (loosely) the following structure:

* **Campaign:** This is the the whole collective story the Players and their Characters engage in.  It is similar to the entire book series, then entire TV show (all seasons), or the full collection of related plays.  *Campaigns* typically take years to complete.
* **Story:** *Campaigns* are broken into *Story*.  Each *Story* could act as an independent *Campaign*, or build on other *Story* to tell a grand overarching narrative.  It is similar to a single book in the series, a single season of a TV show, or a single play.  *Story* will take anywhere between 1 month, to 1 year to complete.
* **Act:** To make telling *Stories* easier, *Chapters* are grouped into *Acts*.  *Acts* are similar to Acts in a play in that they break up the *Story* into logical narrative parts.  They have no game play impact and are only used by *Narrators* to make planning *Stories* and *Campaigns* easier.
* **Chapter:** *Story* are broken into *Chapters*.  *Chapters* typically have a single narrative arc (a problem for the Characters to overcome), and *Chapters* follow the standard Story build-up, climax, and resolution arc typical to most stories.  It is similar to a chapter in a book, a show in a TV series, or an act in a play.  You can expect a *Chapter* to take between 1-3 gaming sessions to complete.
* **Scene:** *Chapters* are broken into *Scenes*.  A *Scene* builds up to a single challenge or opportunity for the Characters involved.  Typically, you will have one major Dice Roll per *Scene*.  It is similar to a page in a book, a scene in a TV show, or play.

## Narration

The role of the Narrator is to facilitate the flow of the Story.  You are there to ensure the Characters have the opportunity to play their part in the grand narrative, and that everyone collaborates in the creation of the Story.  The following section details the various tools you will need to employ to help with Narration.  Later sections will cover ways to combine those tools in your Stories.

<!-- Narrator Tools -->
### Actions

An Action is initiated by a Player and will likely result in their Character having to make a Dice Roll.  The following rules apply to Actions:

* If the Dice Pool for a Dice Roll is greater than the CL for the Action, the Action is successful.
  * Narrative Failure does not make an Action unsuccessful, just costly, complicated, and/or with unforeseen consequences.
* A Narrator must tell the Player if the Action is impossible (ie the Dice Pool is equal or smaller than the CL).
* All Actions must be declared before a Dice Roll is performed.
  * Initiative is used to allow Characters to target another Character's Actions.
* Once declared, an Action can not be changed.  The Character will attempt the Action (even if impossible).

### Initiaitve

Unlike other TTRPGs, Cogent Roleplay uses a reverse order Initiative.  This is because Characters can not change Actions after they are declared, and Characters can target another Character's declared Action as part of their Action.  There are four ways to determine a Character's Initiative score:

1. **Attritional Initiative:** The Character is attempting to both endure the challenges they are facing, and are relying on muscle memory to drive their Actions.
   * These Characters use their STR score as their Initiative.
2. **Reactive Initiative:** The Character is relying heavily on their senses to react to threats and drive their Actions.
   * These Characters use their RFL score as their Initiative.
3. **Tactical Initiative:** The Character is analyzing the situation, and devising strategies to counter their opponents.
   * These Characters use their INT score as their Initiative.
4. **Manipulative Initiative:** The Character is attempting to control the emotional state of their opponents in better to gain an advantage in the situation.
   * These Characters use their CHA score as their Initiative.

#### Running Initiative

1. Determine each Character's Initiative.
   * Not every Character will use the same type of Initiative at the same time.
   * The Initiative type may change in an Encounter based on all the Character's Actions.
2. Starting with the Character with the smallest Initiative, have the Player declare their Action.
   * If two or more Characters have a tied Initiative, have each Player declare their Actions one at a time, then follow up with the NPC's Actions.
   * Consider all Characters with the same Initiative to have declared their Actions at the same time (ie they can not target each other's Actions).
3. Have each Player determine their Character's Dice Pool, and make their Dice Roll.
4. Gather all the results and declare the outcome of the Initiative round.
5. Repeat until Initiative is no longer necessary.

### Narrative Success and Failure

An Action succeeds or fails based on if the Character has a Dice Pool that is greater than the CL for the Dice Roll.  A Dice Roll is instead used to determine how well a Character succeeds or fails.

#### Narrative Success

Each Win above the CL is considered a Narrative Success.  The higher the Narrative Success, the greater the outcome.  Here are some suggestions you can use:

* +1 Injury Level per Narrative Success.
* Increase the CL to detect the effects of the Action (Of course this door was untouched)
* Decrease the time needed to perform the Action (I got it on the first attempt!)
* ±1 Temporary Destiny Pool to a targeted Action (Player's choice)
* Decrease the CP cost for an item or service
* Change the attitude or emotion of the target of your Action (Your powerful strike fills your opponent with fear.)

#### Narrative Failure

Each Win below the CL is considered a Narrative Failure.  It is important to reiterate that Narrative Failures are not automatically failed Dice Rolls, just that the intended Action is more costly than desired.  The higher the Narrative Failure, the greater the cost.  Here are some suggestions you can use:

* +1 Injury Level per Narrative Failure to you.
* Decrease the CL to detect the effects of the Action (Did you hear something?)
* Increase the time needed to perform the Action (PC Load Letter, what the !@$% does that mean!)
* ± Temporary Destiny Pool to a targeted Action (Narrator's choice)
* Increase the CP cost for an item or service
* Change your attitude or emotion because of your Action (That's not a good sound...)

### Injury Levels and Healing

When a Character takes damage they are given injuries.  Injuries are broken into three elements, an injury name, the injury category (Scrapes, Injuries, Wounds, and Trauma), and an injury Level (from 0-5).  Injuries have the following format:

[Name] [injury level] [penalty] *(example: Deep slash, Lvl 3, -3D6)*

| **Category** | **Injury Level** | **Penalty** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Trivial | 0 | -0D6 | Scrapes |
| Trivial | 1 | -1D6 | Bruises |
| Wounded | 2 | -2D6 | Minor Injury |
| Wounded | 3 | -3D6 | Moderate Injury |
| Trauma | 4 | -4D6 | Serious Injury |
| Trauma | 5 | -5D6 | Dead |

Anytime a Character is injured, they must check if they [succeed or fail](#narrative-success-and-failure) an Endurance skill check vs the total of all injury levels the Character has.  If they will automatically fail, they fall unconscious.

> Bob the boxer has endured through 6 grueling rounds, and has now been hit with a devastating uppercut.  
> Bob previously had 2 Level 1 injuries, 1 Level 2 injury, and now has received a Level 3 injury.  Bob has a total of 7 injury levels (1 + 1 + 2 + 3).
> Bob's Endurance Dice Pool is 3D6 + 2D6(STR) + 2D6 (Endurance) or 7D6.  7D6 is not greater than 7CL, so Bob falls to the mat unconscious.

#### Injury Category

There are three injury categories [Trivial, Wounded, and Trauma].  An injury is a Trivial injury if the injury level is 0 or 1, an injury is a Wound if the injury level is 2 or 3, and an injury a Traumatic injury if the injury level is 4 or greater.

#### Healing

There are three types of healing [Natural healing, Medical treatment, and Emergency Care].  Regardless of the type of healing, the CL for the healing check is always the total of all injury levels the patient (injured Character) has.  

**Natural Healing:** Typically once per Chapter a Character may declare they are *Naturally Healing*.  The Character makes an Endurance skill check, with one of two outcomes:

* **Narrative Success:** A Trivial injury is reduced by -1 (removing the injury if the Injury Level is less than 0) per Narrative Success.
* **Narrative Failure:** A non-trivial injury is increased by +1 per Narrative Failure (the same injury can not be increase more than once).

**Medical Treatment:** Medical treatment requires the use of a [Specialization](/Playing%20the%20Game.md#skills) and adequate medical supplies.  Typically a Character can attempt medical treatment on a patient (target Character) once per Chapter.  Narrative Success or Failure affects how long the medical treatment takes (with Narrative Failure increasing the number of days the Character needs treatment).  Medical Treatment reduces the highest non-traumatic injury by -1.

**Emergency Care:** Unlike other methods of healing, emergency care can be used multiple times per Chapter on the same patient.  Each time a Character performs emergency care on a patient (target Character), they are making an injury permanent (ie sacrifice the limb to save the body).  Narrative Success reduces the injury level before it becomes permanent, Narrative Failure increases the injury level of the injury, but the Character may attempt another round of Emergency Care (or lose the patient).  Due to the high risk the patient may die, most emergency care is done as a [collaborative roll](/Playing%20the%20Game.md#assists-and-collaborations).

### Destiny Rolls

Destiny Rolls should be used to quickly resolve situations outside the control of the Players.  All Destiny Rolls use 1D20, and should be made in open with the impact being described to the Players.

The following is a cheat sheet for how difficult an outcome is to favour the Players.

| **Difficulty (%)** | 5% | 10% | 15% | 20% | 25% | 30% | 35% | 40% | 45% | 50% | 55% | 60% | 65% | 70% | 75% | 80% | 85% | 90% | 95% | 100% |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **CL** | 20 | 19 | 18 | 17 | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |

Destiny Rolls are Pass/Fail rolls, and do not use the Narrative Success and Failure mechanic.  Narrators are free to use Narrative Success and Failure if they wish, but the intent of a Destiny Roll is to have a quick outcome of "background" events.

*Example*

> King John's men are traveling through Sherwood Forest with the latest taxes.  They know that Robin Hood and his Merry Men are planning to ambush the convoy, but King John's men have devised several new paths through the forest.<br/>
> The Narrator states that there is roughly a 75% chance that King John's men will hit one of the Merry Men's ambush points, but instead of rolling multiple navigation and perception skill checks, the Narrator decides to do a **Destiny Roll** instead.<br/>
> Since the Players are part of the Merry Men, the Narrator sets the CL at 16 (100% - 75% = 25%) and rolls 13 (a close failure).  The convoy rolls right into the ambush, but their agitated state means they were not fully caught unaware.

## Encounters

This section covers the various ways you can use the Narrator tools to run your games.

### Combat Encounters

Combat is when two or more Characters are attempting to use violence in an encounter.  Combat primarily uses Initiative as the core mechanic.  Narrators should consider the additional components.

#### Combat Range

Combat Ranges are not absolute distances, but effective engagement ranges.  There are five combat ranges:

* **Grapple:** When two or more Characters are in physical contact with each other.  Unless stated otherwise, weapons designed to be used at Thrown, Ranged, or Artillery range, can not be used in grapple range.
* **Melee:** When two or more Characters can easily hit each other with a couple of steps (typically within the same room of a building).  
* **Thrown:** The typically distance that a Character can throw a rock, spear, or dart effectively (typically within 50 yards/meters).  
* **Ranged:** The effective range of a non-thrown weapon (bow, firearm, sling, etc), where distinguishing features can still be made out (typically within 100 yards/meters).  At this range and beyond, melee and grapple weapons can not be used.
* **Artillery:** Any distance beyond Ranged range is considered Artillery.  Weapons that are effective at this range typically use spotters (Assist Action), technology (scopes), or magic (scrying) in order to lock onto a target and hit them.

#### Weapons and Armor

Weapon damage is a combination of three elements, the damage modifier (made up of an Attribute and a number from 0-3), the damage type (bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing), and the primary range (grapple, melee, thrown, ranged, artillery).  Weapons damage is denoted using the following format:

[Attribute]+[damage modifier] [damage type] [primary range] *(example: INT+2 Slashing Melee)*

*As the Narrator you may add additional damage types to your settings.*  

Armor is is a combination of two elements, the Armor Points (AP) (with a value from 1-5), the damage type (bludgeoning, slashing, or piercing).  When a Character receives an Injury Level, they may choose to spend AP to reduce the Injury Level by that amount (ie -1AP per -1 Injury Level).  If the damage type of the armor matches the damage type of the weapon causing the injury, any AP spent is instantly recovered.  AP spent is recovered at the beginning of every scene.  Armor is denoted using the following format:

[AP] [damage type] *(example: 4AP Piercing)*

*Most settings will give Armor a trait value that gives the wearer a Dice Pool penalty when worn.  This is to denote the encumbrances of the armor.*

#### Combat Roll CLs

As a Narrator you must assign the CL for all Dice Rolls based on what works best for the Story, Setting, and the situation around the Dice Roll.  The following is a guide to help in that process.  

* **Combat Range VS Primary Range:** Compare the combat range of the target with the primary range of the weapon.  For each range difference apply a +1CL penalty.
  * **+0 CL:** Combat Range matches Primary Range
  * **+1 CL:** Grapple to Melee, Melee to Grapple or Thrown, Thrown to Melee or Ranged, Ranged to Thrown or Artillery, or Artillery to Ranged
  * **+2 CL:** Grapple to Thrown, Melee to Ranged, Thrown to Grapple or Artillery, Ranged to Melee, or Artillery to Thrown
  * **+3 CL:** Grapple to Ranged, Melee to Artillery, Ranged to Grapple, or Artillery to Melee
  * **+4 CL:** Grapple to Artillery, or Artillery to Grapple
* **Combat Modifiers:** Different combat maneuvers, field conditions, or positions offer advantages or disadvantages.
  * **Attacking while Prone (based off Primary Range) (laying down):** Grapple (+2 CL), Melee (+1 CL), Ranged (-1 CL), Artillery (-2 CL)
  * **Attacking someone that is Prone (based off of Combat Range):** Grapple (-2 CL), Melee (-1 CL), Thrown (+1 CL), Ranged (+2 CL), Artillery (+3 CL)
  * **Attacking from a superior position (ie higher ground):** This will be a -1 to -3 CL advantage (Narrators discretion).  Typically it will be a lower bonus. 
  * **Weapon Traits:** Some weapons will have traits that provide a benefit or penalty to a CL.  Use the weapon trait rules as applicable.
* **Movement:** The faster a your target moves, the harder it is to hit them.  Narrators should modify these penalties if the target is moving towards or away from the Character.
  * **Walking Speed:** +1 CL
  * **Running Speed:** +2 CL
  * **Dodging/Sprint Speed:** +3 CL

### Investigations

Investigations are when two groups of people are attempting to out smart each other while achieving an ultimate objective.  Investigations are broken into two groups; Investigators and Conspirators.

#### Investigators

The goal of the Investigators is to gather the evidence necessary to discover the Conspirators goal, and to use that evidence to either stop the Conspirators from achieving their goal, or making sure they are tied to the conspiracy (served justice).

#### Conspirators

The goal of the Conspirators is to set a goal and execute a plan to both achieve that goal, and get away with it.

### Etiquette

Similar to [Combat Encounters](#combat-encounters), Etiquette encounters have two or more opposed groups of Characters that are attempting to harm each other.  In Etiquette encounters the goal is not to physically harm your opponents, but to marginalize and socially isolate them instead.

### Barter

A Barter encounter is any situation where two or more Characters are attempting to either buy or sell a product or service.  In most situations commerce follows the standard rules for Commerce Points.  Compare the IV (Item Value (ie cost)) of the product/service with the CP (Commerce Points) of the Character.

| **IV-CP** | **Buying** | **Selling** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| >0 | n/a | +(IV-CP) CP |
| 0 | -2 CP | -0 CP |
| -1 | -1 CP | -0 CP |
| -2 | -0 CP | -0 CP |

*Example:*
> Kelly is buying a sword from a merchant.  Both Kelly has 4CP and the merchant has 2CP.  The sword has a cost of 3 IV.<br/>
> When Kelly purchases the sword from the merchant, the IV-CP is -1 (3-4) so Kelly's CP (buying) is reduced by -1 CP.  Kelly now has 3CP.
> The merchant has an IV-CP of +1 (3-2) so the merchant's CP (selling) is increased by +(IV-CP)CP or +1 CP.  The merchant has 3CP.

### Chase/Dogfight

Chases and Dogfights are specialized versions of [Combat Encounters](#combat-encounters) where the distance between the two opponents.  

## World-building & Adaptations

The following section are tools for taking a setting (existing or brand new), and adapting Cogent to the setting.  These tools will provide guidelines on how to created magic system, lists of equipment (weapons, armor, tools etc), and general guidelines to migrate existing rule sets to Cogent.  This section, more than any other section or chapter of the rules, must follow the first rule, and everything listed in this section must serve the Story first and foremost.  These are guildlines, not rules.

### Magic Systems

Within most stories, magic (or supernatural effects like advanced technology or super powers) is roughly divided into two broad categories; Hard Magic systems, and Soft Magic systems.  When you design your setting you must keep these in mind.  

* **Soft Magic:** Magic serves a thematic and narrative purpose within the story.  A defining characteristic of soft magic systems is that how the magic operates does not matter.  Characters use magic in an organic and natural way as per their Character, not based on the rules imposed on them.  An example of this would be that Unicorns have unlimited powers to remove corruption, poison, and toxins, but would never be able to cause them to any person.  Here are the guidelines to creating a soft magic system.
  1. **Magic should be thematic:** How a Character uses magic should serve the narrative feeling of the Character (ie the unicorn).
  2. **Magic should be used naratively:** Magic shouldn't be used to hand wave away problems, but instead as that last ditch effort to serve the story (ie Gandalf only uses the exactly right spell at the exactly right time when the situation is most dire, not when it is convenient).
* **Hard Magic:** Magic is a tool, with defined rules and restrictions.  As a tool, there is an inherent cost to using magic, and this needs to be reflected in your magic system.  How your magic work is critical, because it defines the limits on it's use.  Here are the guidelines to create a hard magic system.
  1. **Magic comes at a cost:** There must be a quantifiable cost for every use of magic.  This cost must be the same for all Characters at all times for the same magical effect (ie all fireball spells cost 100 Mana points to cast).
  2. **Magic is universal:** The rules define how magic is used, not the narrative.  The rules apply equally to all Characters (ie a fireball is a fireball is a fireball).

#### Magic Mechanics

**Magic as a Skill**

This is a good mechanic for a Soft Magic system.  Essentially you have one or more magic Specialisations within a magic using Vocation.  The Narrator would choose the CL based on the precieved difficulty of the act.  In a pure Soft Magic system, the CL should be based on how Naratively relevant the magic use is (ie a mage can't use an open door spell on every single door they come across, that destroys the tension and "fun" of the story).

*Drain Mechanic*

An alternative to *Magic as a Skill* is the drain mechanic.  Each spell (or spell like effect) has an IL (Injury Level).  Casting a spell could cause an Injury.  If you fall unconscience, the spell fails.
